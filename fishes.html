    Hello! You probably stumbled upon this link wondering what this free cookie business is all about. Is it really free? Are we really making cookies with our own time and money and delivering it to you with no strings attached? Yes! Absolutely! Here's why...

    <p>
    Around 2000 years ago, there was a very important man who was well-known for the incredible ways he cared for those who are in need. He would do amazing things, such as healing sick people and giving hope to those who are poor or outcast. On one occasion, he became extremely weary from all the works that he was doing, so he sought for some time alone so that he can eat and rest from all the busyness in his life.

    Unfortunately, he was so popular that wherever he went, people would crowd around him in order to receive from him. Despite his hunger and fatigue, he felt compassion for them, for they were hungry and weary as well from all their travels. Thus, before he ate and rested himself, he and his disciples would feed and care for the multitudes around them, filling them with food (fishes and loaves) and love.

Thus, whenever you're feeling down or overworked late at night, just let us know, and we'll provide you with food and encouragement!
