            <p>
                 Are you the next singing sensation...or closer to the other
                 end of the spectrum? Either way, come out for a fun night of
                 karaoke and bubble tea with Inter-fellowship Association! Sing
                 with your friends or have a solo moment in the spotlight; music
                 and mics will be provided. And if you just want to go for the
                 bubble tea and new friends, that works too. Hope to see (or
                 hear) you there!
